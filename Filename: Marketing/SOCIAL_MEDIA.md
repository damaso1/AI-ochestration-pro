**Title:** "I automated my entire development process - now building MVPs for $0.15"

**Content:**
After burning $20k on developers for simple MVPs, I built an AI orchestration system that chains together free AI tools.

Last week it built:
‚Ä¢ Chrome extension with Notion integration
‚Ä¢ Full-stack SaaS with authentication
‚Ä¢ Automated workflow system

All production-ready code. All under $0.15 per project.

How it works:
1. **Gemini** - Business analysis & market research
2. **Claude** - Technical architecture design
3. **DeepSeek** - Security review & code generation
4. **GitHub** - Automatic deployment

Cost breakdown per project:
- Google AI: $0.02 (free tier)
- Anthropic: $0.05 ($5 free credit)
- DeepSeek: $0.03 (very cheap)
- **Total: $0.10**

I'm opening this up to a few people at $197 (normally $497). Includes the complete n8n workflow, setup guides, and support.

Anyone else tired of $10k MVP costs?

Hey [Name],

I've been using something that feels like cheating at product development.

My AI orchestration workflow just built:
‚úÖ Chrome extension with Notion integration
‚úÖ Full-stack SaaS with user auth
‚úÖ Automated n8n workflow for lead gen

All in under 30 minutes each. All using free AI credits.

The secret? I chain together:
1. Gemini (Google) - Creative ideation
2. Claude (Anthropic) - Architecture  
3. DeepSeek - Code generation & security
4. GitHub - Automatic deployment

Cost per project: $0.08-$0.15

I'm opening this up to a few people. Interested?

**Email 2 - Subject:** "From $10k to $0.15 MVP costs"

Following up on the AI development automation...

Most founders don't realize they can:
- Validate ideas in hours, not months
- Build MVPs for $0.15 instead of $15,000
- Test 10+ ideas per day

The AI Orchestration Pro workflow makes this possible by automating the entire development process.

Early bird special ends soon: $197 (normally $497)
